# Sebastian Wieland

I am a web-developer, proficient in both backend and frontend development.

## About me

- Programming professionally since 2014
- Say what you want, my heart belongs to Java
- Vim is more than an editor, it's a religion
- Team Tabs! Fuck Spaces! (Only with tabs you can `:set ts=<n>` without having
  to <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>g</kbd><kbd>=</kbd><kbd>G</kbd>)
